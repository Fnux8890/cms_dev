## Iterative Approach

We will implement the project in progressive iterations. Each iteration may involve planning, development, testing, documentation, and review. Below is a suggested breakdown of iterative steps:

### Iteration 1: Project Setup & Basic Functionality
1. Folder Structure and Dependencies  
   - Create or refine the core folder structure for Astro, React, Tailwind, ShadCN UI, and Zod.  
   - Ensure Bun is configured, Elysia is optionally set up if required.  
2. Hello World Feature  
   - Create a simple route or page to verify the integrations work.  
3. Minimal Authentication Integration  
   - Use better-auth for a basic login route if feasible.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Add unit tests and an integration test.  
   - Document progress in [Iteration 1 Overview](./tasks/iteration1/iteration1-overview.md).  

### Iteration 2: Content Storage & MDX Foundation
1. MDX Integration  
   - Configure Astro to work with MDX for local and Git-based content.  
2. Basic CMS Flow  
   - Create a simple editor or view for reading MDX.  
3. Auth & Roles  
   - Restrict MDX editing to authenticated users.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Add or update tests for MDX reading and roles.  
   - Document results in [Iteration 2 Overview](./tasks/iteration2/iteration2-overview.md).

### Iteration 3: Expanded CMS Editing Experience
1. Visual Editor Enhancements  
   - Integrate React-based editing components that allow live text updates, preview, or WYSIWYG-like functionality.  
2. Validation & Error Handling  
   - Use Zod for robust client-side and server-side validation.  
3. File and Media Support (Optional)  
   - Add or outline a mechanism for uploading and embedding images, if within project scope.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Perform cross-browser tests for the editor.  
   - Update iteration notes in [Iteration 3 Overview](./tasks/iteration3/iteration3-overview.md).

### Iteration 4: Git Integration & Deployment Setup
1. Git Workflow for Production  
   - Configure commits to a Git repository that stores MDX changes.  
   - Enforce commit message standards, possibly through hooks or third-party integrations.  
2. Vercel Deployment  
   - Set up environment variables, build pipelines, and test a deployment to Vercel.  
3. Authentication Improvements  
   - Ensure user identity is consistent across Git commits if feasible (e.g., track who made changes).  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Perform integration tests to confirm the deployment is stable.  
   - Record findings in [Iteration 4 Overview](./tasks/iteration4/iteration4-overview.md).

### Iteration 5: Security, Performance & Scalability
1. Security Audit  
   - Review usage of better-auth, potential role-based access, and any potential vulnerabilities with the Git content approach.  
2. Performance Tuning  
   - Evaluate SSR vs. SSG or caching strategies with Astro.  
   - Look into Bun runtime optimizations.  
3. Elysia Microservices  
   - Decide if a separate Elysia-based microservice is needed to handle advanced server logic.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Load, stress, and penetration tests.  
   - Document results in [Iteration 5 Overview](./tasks/iteration5/iteration5-overview.md).

### Iteration 6: Advanced CMS Features & Collaboration
1. Real-Time Collaboration (Optional)  
   - Explore or prototype multi-user editing or presence tracking in the MDX editor.  
2. Additional Editor Components  
   - Support code blocks, React components, or other custom MDX elements.  
3. Team Workflows  
   - Outline review/approval steps before content merges to production.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Expand integration tests to cover multiple user roles.  
   - Summarize progress in [Iteration 6 Overview](./tasks/iteration6/iteration6-overview.md).

### Iteration 7: Theming, UI, and Accessibility
1. Theming & Customization  
   - Enhance usage of Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI for advanced theming, light/dark modes, brand styles.  
2. Accessibility (A11y)  
   - Implement WCAG base-level compliance, including keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, etc.  
3. Internationalization (Optional)  
   - If required, begin planning for multi-language content support.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Accessibility testing (e.g., using axe or similar tools).  
   - Document outcomes in [Iteration 7 Overview](./tasks/iteration7/iteration7-overview.md).

### Iteration 8: Plugin System / Extensibility
1. Plugin Architecture  
   - Create an interface for external or internal “plugins” that can extend editing functionalities.  
2. Marketplace (Optional)  
   - If the project aims for a plugin ecosystem, define how others can integrate.  
3. Security & Maintenance  
   - Evaluate each plugin’s access level and vulnerabilities.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Expand test coverage for plugin flows.  
   - Reference findings in [Iteration 8 Overview](./tasks/iteration8/iteration8-overview.md).

### Iteration 9: Feedback, Analytics & Telemetry
1. Usage Analytics  
   - Gather metrics on content changes, user sessions, or editor usage if needed (while respecting privacy laws).  
2. Telemetry Integration  
   - Track system health during editing sessions, potential memory usage under load.  
3. Feedback Loops  
   - Collect user or developer feedback to refine the UI/UX and publishing workflow.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Document analytics/telemetry in [Iteration 9 Overview](./tasks/iteration9/iteration9-overview.md).

### Iteration 10: Polishing & Future Roadmap
1. Final UI/UX Refinements  
   - Review theming, transitions, advanced styling.  
   - Polish any minor UI quirks.  
2. Documentation & Training  
   - Compile a comprehensive user guide, developer doc, or quickstart.  
   - Prepare training materials for new team members or end-users.  
3. Future Outlook  
   - Identify potential future expansions (e.g., new content types, third-party integrations).  
   - Evaluate transitioning from optional Elysia to a stable microservice architecture if needed.  
4. Testing & Documentation  
   - Final regression coverage.  
   - Summaries go in [Iteration 10 Overview](./tasks/iteration10/iteration10-overview.md).

### Working Through Iterations

Each time an iteration is completed, follow these steps:

1. Review Completed Tasks  
   - Update this overview to reflect major completed goals.  
2. Document Lessons Learned  
   - Note issues, solutions, or action items in the iteration’s overview.  
3. Plan the Next Iteration  
   - Create or expand the tasks folder for the next iteration.  
   - Refine requirements based on user feedback, test results, and new insights.

The AI agent (or any team member) can review this file to see what has been done and pick up the next task. Iteration-specific notes, user stories, test plans, and integration details should reside in the corresponding iteration folder.
