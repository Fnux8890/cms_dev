# Project Description

This project is designed to provide an on-site, visually-editable CMS system for managing MDX content. It leverages a modern, performance-oriented tech stack (Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Zod, Bun, and optional Elysia for backend routes) and stores content in Git for production environments while relying on a local file system during development. By combining these technologies, the project aims to deliver a smooth editing experience with robust authentication and authorization features (via better-auth), all packaged for simple deployment on Vercel.

## Intended Users or Audience

- **Content Editors and Marketing Teams**  
  They require an intuitive, visually-driven editing interface for updating site content without deep technical knowledge.

- **Developers**  
  They benefit from a clear and modular architecture that facilitates customization and extension.

- **Project Managers / Stakeholders**  
  They rely on version control for content updates to ensure transparency, collaboration, and a reliable review process.

## Core Features

1. **Visual Editing for MDX**  
   - WYSIWYG-like capabilities for creating and editing MDX content.  
   - React-powered components within Astro to offer responsive editing tools.

2. **Git-Backed Content (Production)**  
   - Changes to MDX content are committed to a shared Git repository, maintaining a complete version history.

3. **Local File System (Development)**  
   - A local folder stores MDX files whenever testing or debugging is needed, speeding up iterative development.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Provided by better-auth to control who can read or modify content, with different user roles as needed.

5. **UI Consistency and Data Validation**  
   - Tailwind CSS and ShadCN for a cohesive, modern interface.  
   - Zod for strong, schema-based validation on both client and server (or serverless functions).

6. **Flexible Deployment**  
   - Hosted on Vercel for simple, scalable deployment.  
   - Uses Bun for runtime performance improvements.  
   - Elysia can be added for more complex backend needs when necessary.

## Data Handling and Storage

- **Production**:  
  - Content is stored in a Git repository, ensuring traceability and facilitating collaboration.  

- **Development**:  
  - MDX content lives in a local folder, giving developers immediate feedback on changes.  

- **Security and Validation**:  
  - better-auth handles authentication.  
  - Zod ensures data integrity and prevents malicious inputs.  
  - Astro, React, or Elysia can incorporate server-side checks or further data sanitization.

---

## Performance Requirements

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
  - Astro builds pages at deploy time to reduce server load and speed up end-user access.

- **Serverless Functions**  
  - Vercel abstracts away server maintenance for dynamic operations (like authentication or content commits).

- **Bun Runtime**  
  - Provides efficient and fast server startup times compared to some other runtimes.

- **Caching and CDN**  
  - Vercel automatically optimizes static assets and leverages global edge networks.

---

## Regulatory or Compliance Considerations

- **Data Privacy**  
  - Ensure proper handling of user credentials and personal data (e.g., GDPR compliance when relevant).

- **Content Licensing**  
  - Maintain compliance with licenses for dependencies (open-source libraries, fonts, UI assets, etc.).

- **Accessibility**  
  - Follow WCAG guidelines to make editing tools and published content accessible to all users.

## Iterative Project Approach

To build this project incrementally while maintaining high code quality, an iterative approach is recommended:

1. **Initialization**  
   - Set up the Astro project structure.  
   - Configure Bun as the default runtime.  
   - Initialize Git repository and configure the local MDX folder for development content.

2. **Core Configuration**  
   - Add Tailwind CSS and ShadCN for styling and UI components.  
   - Integrate React into Astro pages for interactive elements.  
   - Install and configure Zod for validating input and form data.

3. **CMS Prototype**  
   - Build basic MDX editing functionality using React components.  
   - Create a minimal WYSIWYG or block-based editing experience for local testing.  
   - Store data in the local file system only for quick iteration.

4. **Authentication and Roles**  
   - Integrate better-auth to manage user sign-up, login, and session handling.  
   - Set up role-based permissions for editing or viewing unpublished content.

5. **Production Git Integration**  
   - Implement logic that commits changes to the Git repository when users edit content.  
   - Ensure that commit messages are automatically generated or guided by the UI, capturing the changes made.

6. **Elysia API (Optional)**  
   - If advanced back-end routes or microservices are required, integrate Elysia.  
   - Move or extend relevant server-side logic (e.g., advanced content fetching or complex transformations) into Elysia routes.

7. **Verification and Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for React components and Zod validations.  
   - Test authentication flow with multiple roles (e.g., admin, editor).  
   - Verify Git-commit functionality in a staging environment.

8. **Deployment and Scaling**  
   - Set up a production deployment on Vercel.  
   - Utilize serverless functions to handle any dynamic features, such as user sessions or commit triggers.  
   - Monitor performance, logs, and usage metrics.

9. **Documentation and Handover**  
   - Expand and refine documentation within the repository (including usage guides and developer docs).  
   - Train content editors or stakeholders on the new system.  
   - Plan for future iterations or feature expansions based on user feedback.

By following these steps in smaller, testable increments, the project remains flexible and adaptable to changing requirements or new insight gained through user feedback.
