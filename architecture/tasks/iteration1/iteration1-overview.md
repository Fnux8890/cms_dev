# Iteration 1: Overview

In this iteration, we aim to achieve the following:
1. Set up the initial scaffolding (folder structure, basic npm/Node or other environment setup).
2. Implement a basic UI or API endpoint (depending on the project's nature).
3. Write unit tests to confirm minimal functionality.

## Detailed Tasks
1. Establish the Astro and React setup:
   - [x] Validate that Astro can render both static and dynamic pages.
   - [x] Integrate React components for any client-side interactivity.
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Zod:
   - [x] Ensure Tailwind is generating style files correctly.
   - [x] Confirm that ShadCN UI components can be imported without conflicts.
   - [x] Configure basic Zod schemas for any initial form validations.
3. Verify Bun runtime setup (and optional Elysia framework):
   - [x] Check if Bun is properly recognized as the default runtime in dev and build scripts.
   - [ ] If Elysia is used, create a simple "Hello World" route to confirm functionality. (not needed)
4. Minimal Authentication (via better-auth):
   - [x] Add placeholders for sign-up / login routes.
   - [x] Confirm the app can restrict or allow access based on user-auth state.
5. Documentation & Testing:
   - [x] Update [implementation.md](./implementation.md) with instructions on each step.
   - [x] Write basic tests (see [unit-tests.md](./tests/unit-tests.md) and
         [integration-tests.md](./tests/integration-tests.md)) for verifying setup.

Detailed instructions and code examples are available in:
- [implementation.md](./implementation.md)
- [unit-tests.md](./tests/unit-tests.md)
- [integration-tests.md](./tests/integration-tests.md)

Once completed, we will update the [Project Overview](../../overview.md) with a status update and proceed to Iteration 2.
