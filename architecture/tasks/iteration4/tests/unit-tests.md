# Unit Tests (Iteration 4)

- Describe unit tests related to Git commit functions, environment configs, or auth changes.
- Include coverage and any issues discovered.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Write tests for any new modules handling Git commits or environment variables.
- [ ] If Vercel config logic is localizable in code, test environment checks (e.g. dev vs. prod).
- [ ] Extend authentication tests to cover session logic or new role-based features.

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Aim for continuous improvement on coverage (80â€“90%).
- [ ] Document any tests skipped due to partial implementation or future iteration plans.
