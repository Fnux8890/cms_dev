# Implementation (Iteration 4)

Summarize new features and integrations:
- Configured Git-based workflow for MDX commits.
- Set up a Vercel deployment environment.
- Improved auth flows (roles, tokens, etc.).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Git Integration
   - [ ] Confirm previous Git-based content logic or create a new flow for committing MDX changes.
   - [ ] Set up commit message guidelines (optional, but helpful to track content changes).

2. Vercel Deployment Setup
   - [ ] Create a Vercel project and link it to the Git repo.
   - [ ] Configure build commands (e.g., "bun run build" or "npm run build" if not using Bun).
   - [ ] Verify environment variables needed for authentication or database connections.

3. Expanded or Improved Authentication
   - [ ] Integrate advanced session handling (if needed) with better-auth.
   - [ ] Ensure fallback for unauthenticated users (e.g., redirect to login).
   - [ ] Update roles or permission checks to match new use cases.

4. Final Verification & Documentation
   - [ ] Document how to deploy to Vercel in a step-by-step fashion.
   - [ ] Note any domain or SSL configurations if relevant.
   - [ ] Highlight known limitations or next steps for iteration 5.
