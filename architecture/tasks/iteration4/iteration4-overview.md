# Iteration 4: Overview

Goals:
1. Git Integration & Deployment Setup
2. Authentication Improvements
3. System Testing & Documentation

## Detailed Tasks
- [ ] Configure Git-based workflow for MDX commits (if not already done in previous iterations).
- [ ] Set up environment variables and scripts for seamless Vercel deployments.
- [ ] Improve or expand authentication (e.g., token-based roles, advanced session management).
- [ ] Update [implementation.md](./implementation.md) with any new instructions regarding Git or deployment.
- [ ] Plan out test scenarios in [tests/unit-tests.md](./tests/unit-tests.md) and
      [tests/integration-tests.md](./tests/integration-tests.md) for verifying core changes.

See [implementation.md](./implementation.md) for details on what was built. Document tests in [tests/](./tests).
