# Implementation (Iteration 6)

Explain collaboration enhancements:
- Real-time editing or user presence tracking logic.
- New MDX blocks/components for more sophisticated content.
- Potential role-based approvals or article review system. 

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Collaboration & Presence Setup
   - [ ] Decide on a real-time tech stack (WebSockets, Socket.io, etc.) or evaluate existing solutions.
   - [ ] Implement logic to broadcast edits to other connected clients (if full real-time collab is desired).
   - [ ] (Optional) Display user presence info (e.g., “X is editing line #48”).

2. Advanced Editor Components
   - [ ] Add or improve WYSIWYG-like features (tables, inline code, blockquotes, etc.).
   - [ ] Integrate Zod validations for any new forms or data structures introduced in the editor.

3. Role-Based Approvals or Review Flow (Optional)
   - [ ] If implementing an approval system, outline how “editor” vs. “reviewer” roles interact.
   - [ ] Store or track change requests, rejections, or approvals in either local or Git-based storage.

4. Documentation & Next Steps
   - [ ] Update iteration notes with newly introduced components or modules in the CMS.
   - [ ] Record any issues or unsolved tasks to be tackled in iteration 7 or beyond.
