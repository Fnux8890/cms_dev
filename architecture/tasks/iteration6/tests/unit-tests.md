# Unit Tests (Iteration 6)

- Document tests for collaboration logic or advanced components.
- Summarize coverage on newly introduced features.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Test that any newly introduced editor components (tables, code blocks) render and behave as expected.
- [ ] If real-time functionality is included, mock collaborative interactions (e.g., multiple users editing).
- [ ] Validate presence tracking logic (if used) to ensure correct display of active users.
- [ ] Continue or expand Zod schema tests if new schemas are introduced for advanced MDX features.

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Maintain the 80â€“90% coverage target.
- [ ] Document any multi-user test complexities or partial coverage for advanced collab features.
