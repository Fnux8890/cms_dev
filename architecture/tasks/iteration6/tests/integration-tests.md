# Integration Tests (Iteration 6)

- Explain multi-user or multi-role test scenarios.
- Mention any advanced integration flows tested (e.g., presence services).

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Simulate multiple users editing the same document to check for conflicts or real-time updates.
- [ ] Validate presence tracking or user session info if implemented (e.g., “User X is editing paragraph Y”).
- [ ] If a review flow is added, confirm roles (reviewer, editor) follow the correct approval process.

## Recording Results
- [ ] Keep a log of successful vs. failed concurrent edit scenarios.
- [ ] Note any latency, synchronization errors, or data loss if real-time collab is tested.
- [ ] Record next steps or unresolved issues for iteration 7 (e.g., UI refinements, concurrency fixes).
