# Integration Tests (Iteration 8)

- End-to-end tests verifying plugins integrate smoothly with the existing CMS pipeline.
- Check for plugin-based vulnerabilities or performance issues.

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Install or enable at least one sample plugin in a staging environment to validate the full flow:
  - Discovery, registration, runtime usage.
  - Confirm that plugin outputs are rendered correctly in the CMS.
- [ ] Stress-test plugin scenarios to see if performance degrades significantly.
- [ ] Attempt to load a malicious or intentionally broken plugin to ensure security defenses work (sandboxing or permission rejections).

## Recording Results
- [ ] Keep logs of plugin load times, resource usage, and critical errors during integration tests.
- [ ] Document any discovered security flaws or plugin conflicts.
- [ ] Note leftover tasks or improvements for iteration 9 or beyond (e.g., plugin marketplace updates).
