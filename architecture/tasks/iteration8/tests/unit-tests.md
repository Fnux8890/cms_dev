# Unit Tests (Iteration 8)

- Tests covering plugin loading or fallback behavior.
- Validation to confirm no plugin can bypass security constraints.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Write unit tests for the plugin registration process (e.g., “pluginManager.register(plugin)”).
- [ ] Verify that plugins cannot exceed assigned permissions or access unauthorized internal APIs.
- [ ] Test versioning or update logic if such functionality has been introduced.

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Aim for 80–90% coverage on newly introduced plugin-related code.
- [ ] Document any skipped tests, particularly if advanced plugin scenarios require later iterations.
