# Implementation (Iteration 8)

- Describe plugin architecture or extension points.
- Discuss any plugin security measures implemented (e.g., sandboxing or resource limits).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Plugin Interface Definition
   - [ ] Create or refine a stable API for plugins to interact with core CMS features (e.g., add custom MDX blocks, hooks).
   - [ ] Decide on a method of registering/initializing plugins (config file, UI toggle, etc.).

2. Security & Resource Limits
   - [ ] Implement or document how the CMS controls plugin permissions (e.g., file system access, network calls).
   - [ ] Consider sandboxing or limiting plugin memory/CPU usage if relevant.
   - [ ] Validate plugin packages or code against malicious scripts or known vulnerabilities.

3. Maintenance & Upgrades
   - [ ] Outline how plugins will be updated or versioned, ensuring compatibility with core CMS changes.
   - [ ] If a plugin “marketplace” is planned, specify guidelines or a pipeline for publication.

4. Documentation & Next Steps
   - [ ] Document the plugin architecture thoroughly, including code samples if needed.
   - [ ] Note any unresolved issues or advanced plugin features to tackle in future iterations.
