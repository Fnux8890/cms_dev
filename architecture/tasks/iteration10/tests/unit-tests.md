# Unit Tests (Iteration 10)

- Wrap up final coverage on newly introduced polishing features.
- Verify no regressions in code previously considered complete.

+ ## Recommended Approach
+ - [ ] Perform a full pass on all major components to confirm no functional or styling regressions.
+ - [ ] If new final touches were added (e.g., a theme toggle, advanced plugin config), test them explicitly.
+ - [ ] Double-check accessibility or i18n unit tests if updates were made to those areas.
+ 
+ ## Coverage and Maintenance
+ - [ ] Aim to achieve your highest coverage yet (â‰¥90%, if feasible).
+ - [ ] Document any legacy or non-critical areas that remain untested, deciding if they belong in the roadmap.
