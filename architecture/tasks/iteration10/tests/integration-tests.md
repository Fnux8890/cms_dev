# Integration Tests (Iteration 10)

- Conduct a final pass on all integration flows, ensuring the system is production-ready.
- Summarize any last-minute fixes or outstanding tasks.

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Retest core user journeys (e.g., sign in, create/edit MDX content, publish changes).
- [ ] Verify final UI modifications in a staging/production-like environment.
- [ ] Ensure all newly introduced docs, training flows, or help links function properly within the UI.

## Recording Results
- [ ] Maintain a final test report listing each user scenario and pass/fail outcomes.
- [ ] Note any low-priority issues that may be addressed post-launch (record them in the roadmap).
- [ ] If time permits, do a short load test or fallback test (e.g., server down, network issues) to confirm graceful handling.
