# Implementation (Iteration 10)

- Include final UI styling or expansions.
- Document any necessary training materials or user onboarding flows.
- Summarize possible future expansions (features, architecture changes, etc.).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Final UI/UX Polish
   - [ ] Review all pages or components for styling consistency (fonts, colors, spacing).
   - [ ] Address any leftover accessibility or internationalization tickets from earlier iterations.

2. Comprehensive Documentation
   - [ ] Audit existing docs to ensure accuracy and clarity (especially post-feature changes).
   - [ ] Add or update user manuals for content editors or admins, including screenshots if applicable.
   - [ ] Generate or refine developer docs (covering code structure, plugin system, deployment steps, etc.).

3. Training & Onboarding
   - [ ] Create tutorials or short videos demonstrating key features (setup, editing, deployment).
   - [ ] Provide an onboarding checklist for new contributors or power users.

4. Roadmap Planning
   - [ ] Identify long-term goals or major features not covered in the current iterations.
   - [ ] Document backlog items (e.g., advanced analytics, multi-site support, deeper plugin expansions).
   - [ ] Discuss potential architectural changes or tech stack upgrades for future versions.
