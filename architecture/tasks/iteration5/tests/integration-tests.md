# Integration Tests (Iteration 5)

- Load, stress, or endurance tests.
- Document pass/fail criteria and measured performance benchmarks. 

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Run load tests against critical endpoints (authentication, MDX editing, microservice routes).
- [ ] Track response times, error rates, and any resource spikes (CPU/memory).
- [ ] If using Elysia, verify end-to-end flows from the Astro frontend to Elysia endpoints.

## Recording Results
- [ ] Document test scenarios, peak loads, and pass/fail outcomes in a table or log file.
- [ ] For any discovered bottlenecks, note potential solutions or next steps for iteration 6.
- [ ] Summarize final results in the iteration overview or a separate performance report.
