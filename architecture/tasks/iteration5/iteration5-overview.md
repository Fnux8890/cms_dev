# Iteration 5: Overview

Goals:
1. Security Audit & Performance Tuning
2. Optional Elysia Microservice Evaluation
3. Load/Stress Testing
4. Documentation Update

## Detailed Tasks
- [ ] Conduct a thorough security review of better-auth usage, role-based permissions, and API endpoints.
- [ ] Evaluate performance optimizations (e.g., caching, SSR/SSG strategies).
- [ ] Decide whether to introduce (or refine) an Elysia microservice for specialized backend logic.
- [ ] Run load/stress tests and record any bottlenecks or resource limits encountered.
- [ ] Update [implementation.md](./implementation.md) with new configuration details or findings.
- [ ] Document outcomes and next steps in [tests/unit-tests.md](./tests/unit-tests.md) and
      [tests/integration-tests.md](./tests/integration-tests.md).

See [implementation.md](./implementation.md) for what was built. Tests live in [tests/](./tests).
