# Implementation (Iteration 5)

Cover specifics of security improvements and performance enhancements:
- Audited better-auth handling.
- Evaluated caching or SSR vs. SSG strategies.
- Explored or set up Elysia microservice if needed. 

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Security Audit
   - [ ] Review all auth routes and role checks.
   - [ ] Confirm data is sanitized and validated (Zod schemas, etc.).
   - [ ] Check environment variables and secrets for secure storage in production.

2. Performance Tuning
   - [ ] Experiment with SSR vs. SSG to find optimal rendering strategies.
   - [ ] Evaluate caching solutions (e.g., Astro’s built-in caching or Vercel-level cache).
   - [ ] Identify any React components that might benefit from memoization or lazy loading.

3. Elysia Microservice (Optional)
   - [ ] If using Elysia, set up routes for heavier or specialized logic (e.g. image processing, advanced data manipulation).
   - [ ] Ensure Elysia’s performance is tested under expected load, or at least a minimal scenario.

4. Load/Stress Testing & Documentation
   - [ ] Document the testing setup (e.g., k6, JMeter, artillery).
   - [ ] Record any performance metrics and note thresholds where the system starts to slow down.
   - [ ] Update or create readme sections for advanced usage, especially if an Elysia microservice is introduced.
