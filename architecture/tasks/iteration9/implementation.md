# Implementation (Iteration 9)

- Summarize analytics or telemetry integrations.
- Outline feedback channels for users or devs.
- Note any UI/UX changes (based on analytics/friction points).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. Analytics & Telemetry Setup
   - [ ] Choose or confirm an analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics, self-hosted Plausible, custom logs).
   - [ ] Implement code or scripts for capturing key user actions (page views, editor usage, etc.).
   - [ ] Set up telemetry for performance metrics (load times, memory usage) if needed.

2. Feedback Loops
   - [ ] Gather user or dev feedback via integrated forms, GitHub issues, or an in-app feedback button.
   - [ ] Analyze feedback to identify top pain points or requested features.
   - [ ] Document findings and incorporate them into future iteration planning.

3. UI/UX Polishing
   - [ ] Make changes to editor layouts, menu structures, or theming based on user feedback.
   - [ ] Validate that any friction points (e.g., complicated forms) are simplified or better documented.

4. Documentation & Next Steps
   - [ ] Update readme or developer docs to describe analytics and feedback flows.
   - [ ] Note any open questions or design challenges for iteration 10 or beyond.
