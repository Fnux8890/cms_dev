# Unit Tests (Iteration 9)

- Document new tests verifying telemetry data collection or analytics triggers.
- Summarize coverage for any new UI/UX changes.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure analytics calls (or events) fire at expected user actions (e.g., saving MDX, switching editor modes).
- [ ] If you introduced a feedback component, test its basic rendering, form validation(s), and submission behaviors.
- [ ] Check for UI state changes tied to telemetry or analytics logic (e.g., “loading” or “error” states).

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Aim for 80–90% coverage, focusing on newly added analytics and feedback features.
- [ ] Document any complexities in capturing or mocking analytics calls for tests.
