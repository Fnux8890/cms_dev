# Integration Tests (Iteration 9)

- Confirm analytics events fire under real usage.
- Document user feedback acceptance or storage flows.

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Deploy or run a staging environment and simulate normal user flows (editing MDX, navigating pages) to ensure analytics logs are generated.
- [ ] Confirm any feedback channels work end-to-end (submissions, notifications, or stored data).
- [ ] If telemetry tracks performance, perform moderate load tests to see if metrics are accurately recorded.

## Recording Results
- [ ] Keep a timeline or log of analytics events, verifying they match real user steps.
- [ ] Note any missing data points or inaccurate measurements (e.g., incorrect funnel steps).
- [ ] Record user feedback success/failure rates and edge cases (invalid inputs, lost network, etc.).
