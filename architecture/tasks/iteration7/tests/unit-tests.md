# Unit Tests (Iteration 7)

- Outline tests for new UI components, theming states, or ARIA attributes.
- Summarize key findings on coverage.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Write unit tests for theming logic (e.g., verifying color schemes, toggles).
- [ ] Test accessibility-related utilities (does the component have required ARIA attributes, etc.).
- [ ] If i18n is introduced, write tests for language switching or localized content.

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Aim for 80â€“90% coverage, focusing on newly introduced UI code.
- [ ] Document any uncovered scenarios (e.g., advanced screen reader tests or partial i18n).
