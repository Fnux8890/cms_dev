# Integration Tests (Iteration 7)

- Include a11y tests (e.g., via automated scanning like axe).
- If i18n was implemented, test language switching flows.

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Perform end-to-end checks of UI theming toggles in a live environment (light/dark switching).
- [ ] Run accessibility scans (axe, Lighthouse, etc.) to confirm compliance with key WCAG metrics.
- [ ] If multi-language support is added, test user flows in multiple locales (e.g., English, Spanish).

## Recording Results
- [ ] Document a11y scan outcomes, including any violations discovered.
- [ ] Note any theming anomalies or layout breaks in dark mode vs. light mode.
- [ ] Record i18n successes/failures (incorrect translations, missing text) for future iterations.
