# Unit Tests (Iteration 2)

- Indicate the Jest/Mocha tests you wrote for MDX or any new components.
- Summarize coverage.
- Include results and any pending issues.

## Recommended Approach
- [ ] Create tests for verifying MDX file parsing or any new components (e.g., simple editor UI).
- [ ] Check that role-based logic gates (editor vs viewer) work as expected.
- [ ] If new Zod schemas were introduced, add coverage for them (e.g., missing fields, invalid data).

## Coverage and Maintenance
- [ ] Aim for at least 80% coverage again.
- [ ] Document any known limitations (like incomplete Git integration tests if partially implemented).
