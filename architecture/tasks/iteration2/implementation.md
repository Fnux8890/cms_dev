# Implementation (Iteration 2)

Describe the primary changes and code you created for this iteration.  
Note any particular complexities or issues encountered while setting up MDX.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Details
1. MDX Configuration
   - [ ] Install relevant Astro + MDX plugins (e.g., “@astrojs/mdx”).
   - [ ] Confirm local dev environment properly renders MDX pages.

2. Basic CMS Flow
   - [ ] Create a placeholder route or page to fetch/render MDX content from the local file system.
   - [ ] (Optional) Begin hooking up a Git-based backend for production editing.

3. Auth & Roles
   - [ ] Integrate better-auth checks into the MDX route.
   - [ ] Define at least two roles (e.g., “editor”, “viewer”).
   - [ ] Guard editing functionality so only “editor” role can modify or save MDX.

4. Testing & Documentation
   - [ ] Ensure all instructions for setting up MDX, roles, or relevant configs are in this file.
   - [ ] Plan new tests for verifying MDX rendering and authenticated editing.

After completion, consult [../iteration3/iteration3-overview.md](../iteration3/iteration3-overview.md) for the next phase.
