# Iteration 2: Content Storage & MDX Foundation

This iteration expands upon the project's foundation by introducing MDX content handling, Git-based storage (via GitHub and Octokit), an MDX editor interface, and role-based features while ensuring rigorous testing, linting, and type-checking at every step.

---

## Overview

The goal is to build a robust MDX-based content system supported by a Git workflow, leveraging [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) for GitHub integration. Additionally, we will integrate a basic MDX editor and put in place authentication checks that ensure only authorized users can edit or publish content. Throughout this process, every step must include thorough testing (unit, integration, e2e) along with ESLint checks and TypeScript validation.

## 1. MDX Integration Setup ‚úÖ

### 1.1 Configuration Tasks

1. Install Required MDX Dependencies ‚úÖ
   - [x] Install MDX-related packages:  
     ```bash
     bun add @astrojs/mdx rehype-stringify remark-rehype
     ```  
   - [x] Ensure Astro's MDX integration is properly configured in `astro.config.mjs`.
2. Create Directory Structure for MDX Content ‚úÖ
   - [x] Set up the directory tree (`content/posts` and `content/pages`) to store our MDX files.  
3. TypeScript Types for MDX Frontmatter ‚úÖ
   - [x] Created `types.d.ts` with proper TypeScript types for MDX frontmatter.  
4. Update Astro Configuration & Scripts ‚úÖ
   - [x] Package.json includes scripts to run build, dev, and test commands.
   - [x] Commands for TSC checking, ESLint linting, and testing are available.

### 1.2 Testing & Validation Sub-Tasks ‚úÖ

- [x] Unit Tests  
  - [x] Validate MDX frontmatter parsing using a dedicated test suite.
  - [x] Test content collection setup.
  - [x] Verify MDX rendering pipeline with a sample file.  
- [x] TypeScript & ESLint  
  - [x] All new code passes TSC with zero errors.
  - [x] ESLint runs without warnings or errors on the new MDX-related configuration/files.
